# Hero's Journey - Design & Gamification Document
## PEXILIS Challenge 2026

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Concept
**Hero's Journey** is a gamified health app designed to improve treatment adherence in children undergoing long-term chemotherapy by transforming their medical journey into an empowering hero's quest.

### Target User
- **Primary:** Children 6-14 years old with long-term cancer treatment (6+ months)
- **Secondary:** Parents/guardians, oncologists, medical staff
- **Focus User:** Yasmine, 9 years old, acute leukemia, 36 chemotherapy sessions planned

---

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Challenge:**
- 40% of pediatric cancer patients experience significant motivation drop after 2-3 months of treatment
- Children struggle with anxiety, nausea, fatigue, and social isolation
- Traditional medical apps lack emotional connection and engagement
- Patients feel powerless in a process where they have no control

**Opportunity:**
Transform the patient role from "sick child" to "courageous hero" through:
- Emotional connection with a digital companion
- Visual progress and achievement recognition
- Real family support and encouragement
- Age-appropriate gamification mechanics

---

## 3. DESIGN SYSTEM

### Color Palette (4 colors total)
1. **Primary Blue** - `#3B82F6` (Trust, calmness, medical confidence)
2. **Accent Green** - `#22C55E` (Health, growth, healing)
3. **Secondary Orange** - `#FFA500` (Energy, warmth, hope)
4. **Neutral White** - `#FFFFFF` (Clean, accessible, safe)

### Typography
- **Headings:** Bold, friendly sans-serif (Geist Sans)
- **Body:** Clear, dyslexia-friendly sans-serif
- **Font sizes:** 14px minimum for accessibility

## 4. GAMIFICATION SYSTEM (6 Mechanics)

### 1. Virtual Pet Companion 🐉
**Concept:** Child's pet (dragon) grows and evolves alongside their healing journey

**Mechanics:**
- Child selects pet at onboarding (dragon, unicorn, robot, phoenix)
- Pet gains health and evolves after each treatment session
- Pet shows emotional responsiveness (excited, tired, proud)
- Unlockable accessories (crowns, wings, shields) as rewards
- Pet never "dies" - only rests if child is absent (no punishment)

**Emotional Impact:**
- Creates sense of responsibility and companionship
- Child cares for pet, not just themselves
- Visual evolution reinforces progress

---

### 2. Quest Map - Progress Visualization 📍
**Concept:** Treatment sessions represented as islands on a fantasy map

**Mechanics:**
- Each session = one island to complete
- First 5 islands = Bronze Castle milestone
- Sessions 6-15 = Silver Fortress milestone
- Sessions 16-36 = Diamond Palace (final victory)
- Completed islands glow and sparkle
- Future islands visible but dimmed (anticipation, not anxiety)

**Emotional Impact:**
- Clear visual endpoint (Diamond Palace at session 36)
- Tangible progress markers reduce anxiety
- Fantasy setting makes medical journey feel heroic

---

### 3. Daily Missions (Optional) ⭐
**Concept:** Non-mandatory health habits framed as daily quests

**Sample Missions:**
- 💧 Drink 3 glasses of water
- 🍎 Eat a fruit or vegetable
- 🧘 5 minutes of gentle stretching
- 💝 Share a moment with family

**Key Features:**
- "Suggestions for today" language (NOT "Must do")
- No deadlines or countdowns
- Missing a mission = nothing happens (zero punishment)
- Completion gives small energy points for pet

**Emotional Impact:**
- Supports healthy habits without pressure
- Respects child's varying energy levels
- Builds routine gently

---

### 4. Achievement Badges 🏆

- "Water Guardian" - 7 consecutive days of hydration
- "Smile of the Day" - Shared a photo/drawing with family
- "Dragon Master" - All accessories unlocked
- "Legend Born" - 36 sessions completed (VICTORY!)

**Emotional Impact:**
- Celebrates effort and progress
- Creates collectible motivation
- Recognition without shame for missing some

---

### 5. Family Connection Wall 💝
**Concept:** Real-time support messages from family members

**Mechanics:**
- Parents, siblings, grandparents send messages via web/app
- Messages include emoji stickers and small gifts (virtual)
- Child receives notifications (1 max per day, non-intrusive)
- Messages visible in family wall
- Child can reply with sticker reactions

**Key Features:**
- Messages boost pet energy/mood

- Creates accountability and genuine support
- Zero pressure - optional for family members

**Emotional Impact:**
- Tangible evidence of family love
- Reduces isolation during hospital stays
- Builds motivation through relationships

---

### 6. Dynamic Story Narration 📖
**Concept:** Narrative that evolves with treatment progress

**Example Arc:**
- **Phase 1:** "You are the Guardian of Light. Your dragon, Nour, was wounded by shadow forces..."
- **Phase 2:** "Session by session, Nour grows stronger. Your bond deepens..."
- **Phase 3:** "The shadows retreat. Nour's wings are fully formed. You are becoming a legend..."
- **Phase 4:** "Victory! Together, you have healed the realm. You are a true HERO."

**Optional Features:**

## 14. DESIGN DECISIONS & RATIONALE

### Why a Dragon?
- Powerful but friendly archetype
- Culturally significant (Asian representation)
- Clearly non-human (imaginative escape from reality)
- Evolves visually (perfect for progress metaphor)
- Can wear accessories (character customization)

### Why Quest Map?
- Visual progress is powerful for children
- Islands = discrete, manageable sessions (not overwhelming)
- Milestones at 5, 15, 36 (psychological progression)
- Fantasy setting reframes medical journey

### Why No Punishments?
- Children in treatment already experience enough pain
- Fear/guilt = worse adherence outcomes
- Failure to complete = often medical necessity (child too sick)
- Punishment triggers depression and withdrawal

### Why Family Wall?
- Medical studies show family support = 3x better outcomes
- Isolation is major contributor to depression
- Real love is more motivating than gamification
- Builds accountability in healthy way

### Why 1 Notification/Day Max?
- Too many notifications = fatigue and ignorance
- Children deal with enough medical alerts
- Respects peaceful times
- Quality over quantity

---

## 17. PRESENTATION STRATEGY

### Story Arc
**"Meet Yasmine. She's 9. She has 36 chemotherapy sessions ahead."**

- Problem: 40% of kids like Yasmine lose motivation after 2-3 months
- Insight: Games engage children, but health apps don't use games ethically
- Solution: Hero's Journey transforms her treatment into an empowering quest
- Impact: With her pet Nour, her family's support, and a clear path to victory...
- Outcome: Yasmine doesn't attend chemotherapy. She goes on an adventure.

### Demo Flow
1. **Home Screen** - "Here's Yasmine's starting point"
2. **Celebration** - "What happens after she completes a session (emotional peak)"
3. **Quest Map** - "She can see her full journey - 36 sessions to victory"
4. **Pet Profile** - "Her pet Nour grows with her - she's not healing alone"
5. **Daily Missions** - "Gentle health habits, never mandatory, no guilt"
6. **Family Wall** - "Real love from family - more powerful than any game mechanic"

### Closing
**"Gamification works. But gamification for health—especially for vulnerable children—must be ethical. Hero's Journey proves you can build an engaging, sustainable, impactful app without dark patterns. It's good game design + good medicine + good humanity."**
