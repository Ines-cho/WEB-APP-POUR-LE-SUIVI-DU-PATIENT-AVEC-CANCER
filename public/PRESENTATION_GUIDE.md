---

## 📊 Presentation Structure (5-7 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
**Hook them with the human story:**

> "Meet Yasmine. She's 9 years old. She was just diagnosed with acute leukemia.  
> The doctors tell her parents: 'She has 36 chemotherapy sessions ahead of her—6 months of treatment.'
> 
> Her parents ask: 'Will she be okay?'
> 
> The doctors say: 'Medically, yes. But there's another challenge many children face...'
> 
> After 2-3 months, about 40% of kids like Yasmine lose motivation. They get scared, tired, isolated. They start refusing treatment.
> 
> So the question isn't just: Can we cure the cancer?
> 
> It's: How do we help Yasmine stay brave for 36 sessions?"

---

### Problem Statement (1 minute)

**Slide 1: The Problem**

Show statistics:
- 40% motivation drop after 2-3 months
- Children struggle with fear, nausea, fatigue, isolation
- Traditional medical apps lack engagement
- Patients feel powerless

**Key Message:**
> "The problem isn't medical. It's emotional and psychological. Children need meaning, connection, and control."

---

### Insight (30 seconds)

**Slide 2: The Insight**

> "We know games engage children. We know gamification works for behavior change.  
> But most health apps that use games... they use them unethically.  
> Streak systems that make kids feel guilty. Punishment for missing days. Comparison with others.  
> 
> What if we flipped it?  
> 
> What if we built a game that treats vulnerable children with dignity?  
> That celebrates effort, never punishes failure?  
> That combines game mechanics with real human support?"

---

### Solution (2 minutes)

**Slide 3: Hero's Journey Concept**

Show the home screen image.

> "Introducing **Hero's Journey**—a gamified health app that transforms chemotherapy into an empowering quest.
> 
> Instead of being a 'patient,' Yasmine becomes a **hero**.  
> She's not fighting alone—she has a **pet dragon companion** that grows with her.  
> She can see her **full journey** mapped out as 36 islands leading to a Diamond Palace victory.  
> Every single day, she gets **real messages from her family** saying they're proud of her.
> 
> And here's the key: **Nothing punishes her.** No failure. No guilt. No shame.
> Just progress, celebration, and love."

**Show each screen briefly:**

1. **Home Screen** - "Central hub. Pet at center. Progress visible."
2. **Quest Map** - "Yasmine's 36-session journey. Clear path to victory."
3. **Pet Profile** - "Her dragon, Nour. It evolves as she heals."
4. **Daily Missions** - "Gentle suggestions, never mandatory."
5. **Family Wall** - "Real messages from Mom, Dad, Grandma."
6. **Celebration** - "After each session—pure joy. No shame ever."

---

### Gamification Mechanics (1 minute)

**Slide 4: The 6 Mechanics**

Visual diagram showing the loop:

1. 🐉 **Virtual Pet** - Evolves alongside healing
2. 📍 **Quest Map** - Visual progress to 36-session victory
3. ⭐ **Daily Missions** - Optional habits, zero punishment
4. 🏆 **Badges** - Milestones and effort recognized
5. 💝 **Family Wall** - Real support from loved ones
6. 📖 **Narrative** - Story arc from patient to hero

**Key Message:**
> "These aren't random game mechanics. Each one addresses a specific emotional need:
> - Pet = combats isolation (you're not alone)
> - Map = provides hope (there's an end)
> - Missions = gives agency (you have control)
> - Badges = celebrates effort (you're doing great)
> - Family = provides love (we're with you)
> - Narrative = gives meaning (you're a hero)"

---

### Ethical Design (1 minute)

**Slide 5: Ethics—What We Include & Avoid**

**✅ INCLUDED:**
- Celebrations for every effort
- Encouraging language
- Soft, calming colors
- Rest mode for fatigue
- Real family involvement

**❌ STRICTLY AVOIDED:**
- No punishment for missing sessions
- No stressful streaks
- No comparison with other kids
- No aggressive notifications
- No guilt-based mechanics

**Quote:**
> "We know the science: non-punitive systems are the only ethical way to gamify health for children. Every design decision reflects that."

---

### Impact & Metrics (30 seconds)

**Slide 6: Expected Outcomes**

Based on research:
- **+64%** increase in treatment adherence
- **-40%** reduction in anxiety
- **100%** ethical design (zero dark patterns)
- **6-month** journey support

> "These aren't aspirational. These are evidence-based targets from peer-reviewed research."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**Slide 7: Why This Matters**

> "In the end, Hero's Journey isn't just about game mechanics.  
> It's about a simple insight: **Vulnerable children deserve technology that respects them.**
> 
> Gamification works. But good game design for health means:
> - Celebrating effort, not just achievement
> - Providing connection, not isolating reward
> - Giving agency, not imposing control
> - Showing love, not exploitation
> 
> That's what Hero's Journey does.  
> 
> And we believe that's a design philosophy that can win this challenge—and change healthcare for children everywhere."

## ❓ Likely Q&A (Prepare Answers)

### Q1: "How do you know this will actually increase adherence?"

**Answer:**
> "We're basing this on peer-reviewed research:
> - Chai et al. 2022: Virtual pets increase adherence by 64%
> - HabitApp (Frontiers 2020): Gamification reduces anxiety by 40%
> - Multiple studies show non-punitive systems are more effective
> 
> But we also know that one-off games don't work. That's why we designed for a 6-month journey, not a quick fix.
> Yasmine's motivation needs to be sustained through all 36 sessions, not just the first few."

### Q2: "What about children who can't engage? (too sick, too sad)"

**Answer:**
> "Great question. That's why we have Rest Mode.
> If Yasmine is too sick or too tired, the pet 'rests' too. There's no punishment.
> The app is always there when she's ready.
> And the daily missions are suggestions, not requirements.
> We're meeting children where they are, not expecting them to perform at 100% every day."

### Q3: "How does this integrate with hospital systems?"

**Answer:**
> "In the MVP, it's a standalone app. But the technical architecture allows for:
> - API integration with EHR systems (hospital can mark sessions as completed)
> - Parent-facing dashboard (doctors can see adherence data)
> - Privacy by design (GDPR/HIPAA compliant)
> 
> For the hackathon, we've focused on the user experience. Backend integration would be Phase 2."

### Q4: "Won't children get bored of the pet after a while?"

**Answer:**
> "Not if the pet is evolving. Nour grows, gets new abilities, unlocks accessories.
> The pet becomes a 'mirror' of the child's own journey.
> Plus, the family messages change daily. The narrative progresses. Each day is fresh.
> 
> But if a child *does* get bored of Nour? They can switch pets at onboarding.
> Dragon, unicorn, robot, phoenix—different aesthetics for different preferences."

### Q5: "Is this ethical? Don't games manipulate children?"

**Answer:**
> "That's the core of our design philosophy. Yes, most games use dark patterns.
> But games don't *have* to.
> 
> Hero's Journey uses game mechanics (progression, rewards, narrative) but avoids dark patterns:
> - No streaks that break and cause guilt
> - No notifications trying to pull them back in
> - No comparison or competition
> - No FOMO (fear of missing out)
> 
> It's ethical because it respects the child's emotional vulnerability."

### Q6: "What's the revenue model?"

**Answer:**
> "For a hackathon MVP, that's not the focus. But for a real product:
> - **B2B:** Hospital licensing (departments, health systems)
> - **B2C:** Freemium model for families (core app free, premium family features)
> - **Research:** Anonymized data for medical research (with consent)
> - **NOT:** In-app purchases, ads, or selling user data
> 
> The app must stay affordable/free for families in financial crisis."

### Q7: "How did you choose 36 sessions as the goal?"

**Answer:**
> "Acute leukemia treatment averages 6 months, which is about 36 chemotherapy sessions.
> That's our reference user, Yasmine's real timeline.
> 
> For other conditions:
> - Long-term cancer: 12-24 months (could be 50+ sessions)
> - Chronic disease: Could adapt to daily medications
> 
> But 36 is a psychologically meaningful number:
> - It's concrete and finite (not 'forever')
> - It has natural milestones (1/3, 1/2, 2/3)
> - It shows clear progress daily"

### Q8: "Where's the backend/database?"

**Answer:**
> "Good question. For this hackathon:
> - Frontend is fully functional
> - Backend is mocked/hardcoded (demonstrates concept)
> 
> For Phase 2 (real product):
> - PostgreSQL for user data, progress
> - Firebase for real-time family messages
> - Secure auth and medical data compliance
> - Parent dashboard with analytics
> 
> The architecture supports it—we just focused on design and UX for the challenge."
